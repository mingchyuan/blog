# 【3-5】Loops - While and For

We have already encountered the `while` and `for` loops.

## While loop

In

```algorithm
\begin{algorithmic}
\State while (expression)
\State $\qquad$statement
\end{algorithmic}
```

the $expression$ is evaluated. If it is non-zero, $statement$ is executed and $expression$ is re-evaluated. This cycle continues until $expression$ becomes zero, at which point execution resumes after $statement$.

## For loop

The `for` statement

```algorithm
\begin{algorithmic}
\State for (expr1; expr2; expr3)
\State $\qquad$statement
\end{algorithmic}
```

is equivalent to

```algorithm
\begin{algorithmic}
\State expr1;
\State while (expr2) \{
\State $\qquad$statement
\State $\qquad$expr3;
\State \}
\end{algorithmic}
```

except for the behaviour of `continue`, which is described in Section 3.7.

Grammatically, the three components of a `for` loop are expressions. Most commonly, $expr_1$ and $expr_3$ are assignments or function calls and $expr_2$ is a relational expression. Any of the three parts can be omitted, although the semicolons must remain. If $expr_1$ or $expr_3$ is omitted, it is simply dropped from the expansion. If the test, $expr_2$, is not present, it is taken as permanently true, so

```c
for (;;) {
    ...
}
```

is an "infinite" loop, presumably to be broken by other means, such as a `break` or `return`.

## Usage Comparison

Whether to use `while` or `for` is largely a matter of personal preference.

The analogy is not perfect, however, since the index variable `i` retains its value when the loop terminates for any reason. Because the components of the `for` are arbitrary expressions, `for` loops are not restricted to arithmetic progressions. Nonetheless, it is bad style to force unrelated computations into the initialization and increment of a `for`, which are better reserved for loop control operations.

> [!example]
> As a larger example, here is another version of `atoi` for converting a string to its numeric equivalent. This one is slightly more general than the one in Chapter 2; it copes with optional leading white space and an optional + or - sign. (Chapter 4 shows `atof`, which does the same conversion for floating-point numbers.)

> [!example]
> The advantages of keeping loop control centralized are even more obvious when there are several nested loops. The following function is a Shell sort for sorting an array of integers. The basic idea of this sorting algorithm, which was invented in 1959 by D. L. Shell, is that in early stages, far-apart elements are compared, rather than adjacent ones as in simpler interchange sorts. This tends to eliminate large amounts of disorder quickly, so later stages have less work to do. The interval between compared elements is gradually decreased to one, at which point the sort effectively becomes an adjacent interchange method.

> There are three nested loops. The outermost controls the gap between compared elements, shrinking it from $\frac{n}{2}$ by a factor of two each pass until it becomes zero. The middle loop steps along the elements. The innermost loop compares each pair of elements that is separated by `gap` and reverses any that are out of order. Since `gap` is eventually reduced to one, all elements are eventually ordered correctly. Notice how the generality of the `for` makes the outer loop fit in the same form as the others, even though it is not an arithmetic progression.

## Comma operator

One final C operator is the comma `,`, which most often finds use in the `for` statement. <mark>A pair of expressions separated by a comma is evaluated left to right, and the type and value of the result are the type and value of the right operand.</mark> Thus in a `for` statement, it is possible to place multiple expressions in the various parts, for example to process two indices in parallel. This is illustrated in the function `reverse(s)`, which reverses the string `s` in place.

```c
#include <string.h>

/* reverse: reverse string s in place */
void reverse(char s[])
{
    int c, i, j;

    for (i = 0, j = strlen(s) - 1; i < j; i++, j--) {
        c = s[i];
        s[i] = s[j];
        s[j] = c;
    }
}
```

The commas that separate function arguments, variables in declarations, etc., are *not* comma operators, and do not guarantee left to right evaluation.

Comma operators should be used sparingly. The most suitable uses are for constructs strongly related to each other, as in the `for` loop in `reverse`, and in macros where a multistep computation has to be a single expression. A comma expression might also be appropriate for the exchange of elements in reverse, where the exchange can be thought of a single operation:

```c
for (i = 0, j = strlen(s) - 1; i < j; i++, j--) {
    c = s[i], s[i] = s[j], s[j] = c;
}
```
