# 【7-2】Formatted Output - printf

The output function `printf` translates internal values to characters. We have used `printf` informally in previous chapters. The description here covers most typical uses but is not complete; for the full story, see Appendix B.

```c
int printf(char *format, arg1, arg2, ...);
```

`printf` converts, formats, and prints its arguments on the standard output under control of the `format`. It returns the number of characters printed.

The format string contains two types of objects: ordinary characters, which are copied to the output stream, and conversion specifications, each of which causes conversion and printing of the next successive argument to `printf`. Each conversion specification begins with a `%` and ends with a conversion character. Between the `%` and the conversion character there may be, in order:

- A minus sign, which specifies left adjustment of the converted argument.
- A number that specifies the minimum field width. The converted argument will be printed in a field at least this wide. If necessary it will be padded on the left (or right, if left adjustment is called for) to make up the field width.
- A period, which separates the field width from the precision.
- A number, the precision, that specifies the maximum number of characters to be printed from a string, or the number of digits after the decimal point of a floating-point value, or the minimum number of digits for an integer.
- An `h` if the integer is to be printed as a `short`, or `l` (letter ell) if as a `long`.

Conversion characters are shown in Table 7.1. If the character after the % is not a conversion specification, the behavior is undefined.

| Character | Argument type; Printed As                                                                                                                                                              |

<p style="text-align: center;">Table 7.1 Basic Printf Conversions</p>

A width or precision may be specified as `*`, in which case the value is computed by converting the next argument (which must be an `int`). For example, to print at most `max` characters from a string `s`,

```c
printf("%.*s", max, s);
```

Most of the format conversions have been illustrated in earlier chapters. One exception is the precision as it relates to strings. The following table shows the effect of a variety of specifications in printing "hello, world" (12 characters). We have put colons around each field so you can see it extent.

```text
:%s:            :hello, world:
:%10s:          :hello, world:
:%.10s:         :hello, wor:
:%-10s:         :hello, world:
:%.15s:         :hello, world:
:%-15s:         :hello, world :
:%15.10s:       : hello, wor:
:%-15.10s:      :hello, wor :
```

> [!warning]
> `printf` uses its first argument to decide how many arguments follow and what their type is. It will get confused, and you will get wrong answers, if there are not enough arguments of if they are the wrong type. You should also be aware of the difference between these two calls:

```c
printf(s);       /* FAILS if s contains % */
printf("%s", s); /* SAFE */
```

The function `sprintf` does the same conversions as `printf` does, but stores the output in a string:

```c
int sprintf(char *string, char *format, arg1, arg2, ...);
```

`sprintf` formats the arguments in `arg1`, `arg2`, etc., according to `format` as before, but places the result in `string` instead of the standard output; `string` must be big enough to receive the result.
