# 【3-1】Data Types

## Data inside the computer

All data types are transformed into a uniform representation when they are stored in a computer and transformed back to their original form when retrieved. This universal representation is called a **bit pattern**, as discussed shortly.

### Bits

A **bit** (**binary digit**) is the smallest unit of data that can be stored in a computer and has a value of

- $0$
- $1$

A bit represents the state of a device that can take one of two states.

### Bit patterns

To represent different types of data, we use a **bit pattern**, a sequence, or as it is sometimes called, **a string of bits**.

By tradition a bit pattern with eight bits is called a **byte**. Sometimes the term **word** is used to refer to a longer bit pattern.

The same pattern can represent part of an image, part of a song, or part of a scene in a film. The computer's memory stores all of them without recognizing what type of data they represent.
