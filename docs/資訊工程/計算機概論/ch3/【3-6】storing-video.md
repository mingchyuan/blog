# 【3-6】Storing Video

**Video** is a representation of images (called **frames**) over time. A movie consists of a series of frames shown one after another to create the illusion of motion. In other words, video is the representation of information that changes in space (single image) and in time (a series of images).

Today video is normally compressed. In [Chapter【15】][] we discuss **MPEG**, a common video compression technique.
