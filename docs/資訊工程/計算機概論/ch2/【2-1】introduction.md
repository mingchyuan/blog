# 【2-1】Introduction

A **number system** (or numeral system) defines how a number can be represented using distinct symbols. A number can be represented differently in different systems.

For example, the two numbers $(2A)_{16}$ and $(52)_8$ both refer to the same quantity, $(42)_{10}$, but their representations are different. This is the same as using the words *cheval* (French) and *equus* (Latin) to refer to the same entity, a *horse*.

As we use symbols (characters) to create words in a language, we use symbols (digits) to represent numbers. However, we know that the number of symbols (characters) in any language is limited. We need to repeat characters and combine them to create words. It is the same for numbers: we have a limited number of symbols (digits) to represent numbers, which means that the digits need to be repeated.

Several number systems have been used in the past and can be categorized into two groups:

- positional
- nonpositional systems

Our main goal is to discuss the positional number systems, but we also give examples of nonpositional systems.
