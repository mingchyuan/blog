# 【6-7】Transmission Media

Electrical signals created at the physical layer need transmission media to go from one point to another. Transmission media are actually located below the physical layer and are directly controlled by the physical layer. We could say that transmission media belong to layer zero.

A **transmission medium** can be broadly defined as anything that can carry information from a source to a destination.

In telecommunications, transmission media can be divided into two broad categories:

- Guided media

    Provide a conduit from one device to another.

    - Twisted-pair cable
    - Coaxial cable
    - Fiber-optic cable

- Unguided media: wireless

    Transport electromagnetic waves without using a physical conductor.

    - Radio waves
    - Microwaves
    - Infrared
